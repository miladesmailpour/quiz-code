## How to Contribute

Challenges repository
This is an open source project which has Licensed by MIT which allow you to contribute and used open source codes used in this repo (All Branches).
More info: https://g.co/kgs/QWcHhF

- Branches are named as module[n] and each one of them its unique challenge.
- Master Branch contain the last solved challenge. (the read me your are reading trough, it is a defult guid when NO challage availabel to help you do a pre-setup.)

# how to use the module and deploy

- Clone the repo and make it own

  # Https url :

        git clone https://github.com/miladesmailpour/challanges.git

  # ssh url :

        git clone git@github.com:miladesmailpour/challanges.git

  # Checking the fetch/pull and push url :

        git remote -v

  # Modifing origin url :

        git remote add origin [https/ssh url of you repo] https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo

  # Verifing the fetch/pull and push url :

        git remote -v https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/managing-remote-repositories

  # Chacking the status of local :

        git status

        "if local NOT updated"
        git add .
        git commit -m "[your comment]"
        git push origin master/main

- Checkout to the module (the challenge you want to used and deploy)
  # Checkout to the disred challage :
       git checkout module[n]
  # Verifing :
       git status
  # [Make the change you wish to have]
       What do you think needed to improve?
  # Commiting to local and updating the GitHub repo:
         git add .
         git commit -m "[your comment]"
         git push origin [your module name]
- Moving Modules to Master Branch and deploy :
