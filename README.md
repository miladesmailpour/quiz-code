 # how to use the module and deploy
 
  - Clone the repo and make it own
      # Https url : 
          git clone https://github.com/miladesmailpour/challanges.git
      # ssh url :
          git clone git@github.com:miladesmailpour/challanges.git
      # Checking the fetch/pull and push url : 
          git remote -v
      # Modifing origin url : 
          git remote add origin [https/ssh url of you repo] https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo
      # Verifing the fetch/pull and push url : 
          git remote -v https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/managing-remote-repositories
      # Chacking the status of local : 
          git status
          
          "if local NOT updated"
          git add .
          git commit -m "[your comment]"
          git push origin master/main
   
   - Checkout to the module (the challenge you want to used and deploy)
      # Checkout to the disred challage : 
          git checkout module[n]
      # Verifing : 
          git status
      # [Make the change you wish to have]
          What do you think needed to improve?

            git add .
            git commit -m "[your comment]"
            git push origin [your module name]
  - Moving Modules to Master Branch and deploy :
      # Creating a pull request to update the master/main :

# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Your Task

At some point in your journey to become a full-stack web developer, you’ll likely be asked to complete a coding assessment&mdash;perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

To help familiarize you with these tests and allow you to use the skills covered in this module, this Challenge invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

This week’s coursework will equip you with all the skills you need to succeed in this assignment.

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
